# Hi there, I'm **Harsh Banugariya**👋 

## **About Me**  
Excited to be at the cutting edge of AI & Data! I specialize in transforming complex data into strategic insights. I design and build scalable data platforms and intelligent data pipelines that deliver measurable business value. With expertise in SQL, Python, Snowflake, Power BI, Fabric, Azure, AWS, Alteryx, Power Automate, and SAP data ecosystems, I manage end to end data workflows from ETL/ELT and warehousing to automation and advanced analytics ensuring reliability, scalability, and high performance.

My work increasingly leverages AI and ML techniques. Using Python for feature engineering, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling, I enable demand forecasting and automated KPI tracking. By embedding machine learning models into analytics workflows and harnessing generative AI, I help organizations achieve smarter, faster, and more adaptive decision making.

I combine a strong technical foundation in data wrangling, data mining, profiling, and modeling with a business first mindset, ensuring every solution is both technically robust and strategically aligned. I thrive at the intersection of Data Engineering, Analytics, AI, and ML bringing together engineering precision, analytical depth, automation expertise, and clear communication to deliver innovation and meaningful transformation.
