# Hi there, I'm **Harsh Banugariya**👋 

## **About Me**  
Driven by a passion for Data, Analytics, AI, and ML, I specialize in turning complex datasets into strategic insights. As a Microsoft Certified Power BI Data Analyst and Fabric Analytics Engineer, I design and build scalable data platforms and intelligent pipelines that deliver measurable business value. With expertise in SQL, Python, Snowflake, Power BI, Azure, and AWS, I manage end to end data workflows from ETL/ELT and warehousing to advanced analytics ensuring reliability, scalability, and performance.

My work increasingly leverages AI and ML techniques. Using Python libraries for feature engineering, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling, I enable demand forecasting, risk detection, and automated KPI tracking. By embedding machine learning models into analytics workflows and harnessing generative AI, I empower organizations with smarter, faster, and more adaptive decision-making.

I combine a strong technical foundation in data wrangling, profiling, and modeling with a business first mindset, ensuring every solution is not only technically robust but also strategically aligned. I thrive at the intersection of Data Engineering, Analytics, AI, and ML bringing together engineering precision, analytical depth, and clear communication to deliver innovation and meaningful transformation.
